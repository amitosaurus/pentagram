**<u>Status</u>**:	Proposed

**<u>Context</u>**: From the scenario shared, we have highlighted problem areas & gaps that need to be addressed

**<u>Consequences</u>**:

Based on the above decision, we will narrow down the architectural styles that can be used while moving away from the existing monolith. While not all "*ilities*" can be accommodated simultaneously, certain tradeoffs will be made and priorities will be determined when picking the architectural style [in adr_002-00_ArchitectureStyle.md].

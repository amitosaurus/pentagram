# Product Enhancements

We propose that the Knowledge Base can be leveraged in the future to build AI models that can then serve to provide self-service options/suggestions to customers for simple problems with their gadgets. Further, that can be extended to CSRs to provide phone support and save on the bandwidth of Experts, who can be dispatched only for the more complicated jobs.

This will also help reduce the load on the system, reduce costs and increase efficiency.

# Architecture Roadmap

In the subsequent iterations the architecture team would like to :
- Revise the current documentation 
- Build implementation plan
- Cost analysis
- Collaborate on bulding a product roadmap
